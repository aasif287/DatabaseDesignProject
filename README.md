# Database Design Project 

## Overview

This Database Project will require creating an online application using PHP and MySQL to interface a project database. The goal is to provide user interfaces for different roles identified in the design stages, allowing users to interact with the database through the online application. The application should support insert, update, delete actions, as well as search functionalities. Additionally, it should present reports generated from the database information.
